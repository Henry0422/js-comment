This is a pure front-end React app. I have deployed the React App to GitHub Pages already

In the project directory, you can run the app:
1. `npm start`
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This app uses the Material-UI as the UI library for the style of the buttons. [https://material-ui.com/components/buttons/](https://material-ui.com/components/buttons/)

The time-ago count uses a npm package called react-timeago
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timeago](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timeago)

The main implementation is in `main.js`
Most of the CSS styles are in `main.css`
